Tel-Insights: A Technical Architecture and Implementation BlueprintExecutive SummaryThis document presents a comprehensive technical architecture and implementation blueprint for the "Tel-Insights" project. The project's goal is to construct a sophisticated system for aggregating and analyzing news from Telegram channels using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) 1. The proposed architecture is founded on a resilient microservices framework, designed to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability.The core architectural strategy advocates for a set of independently deployable services communicating primarily through an asynchronous message queue. This design decouples critical components, guaranteeing that the high-volume data ingestion process is not hindered by the variable processing times of downstream analytical services. This approach is fundamental to upholding the system's promise of complete and real-time data capture.Python is endorsed as the universal development language, leveraging its unparalleled ecosystem for AI/ML, data processing, and web services 1. The technology stack has been meticulously selected based on a rigorous analysis of the project's specific requirements. PostgreSQL is the definitive choice for relational data storage due to its superior support for JSONB data, advanced indexing, and extensibility, which are critical for handling the rich metadata generated by the AI module 2. For the crucial task of connecting to Telegram as a user, the Telethon library is recommended for its direct access to the MTProto protocol, while the python-telegram-bot library is selected for building the user-facing bot interface 5.For the AI analysis itself, the architecture is designed to be model-agnostic. However, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is recommended as the initial model due to its native multimodal capabilities and extensive context window, which align with the project's long-term vision 7. Consequently, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is recommended for media storage to co-locate data with the AI compute, thereby minimizing costly data egress fees 9.The deployment strategy embraces a hybrid model, utilizing Kubernetes for core, stateful services and a Serverless approach for the event-driven, computationally intensive AI analysis module. This optimizes both cost and scalability. The report concludes with a detailed task breakdown and a phased implementation roadmap, providing a clear and actionable path from development to a successful production launch.Table 1: Recommended Technology Stack SummaryModuleRecommended TechnologyKey JustificationAggregator ModulePython, TelethonRequired for connecting as a Telegram user via the MTProto protocol; Telethon is the actively maintained standard 5.Data Storage ModulePostgreSQLSuperior JSONB support, advanced indexing (GIN), and extensibility (PostGIS) are critical for AI metadata and future features 2.Media Storage ModuleGoogle Cloud Storage (GCS)Co-location with the recommended Gemini LLM minimizes data egress costs for media analysis and offers competitive pricing 9.Advanced AI Analysis ModulePython, Google Gemini 2.5 ProNative multimodality, large context window, and strong performance.

These principles are chosen to ensure the final product is not only functional but also resilient, scalable, and maintainable, directly addressing the challenges inherent in a real-time, data-intensive application.1.1 Adopting a Resilient Microservices FrameworkThe project specification logically divides the system into six distinct functional units: Aggregator, Data Storage, Media Storage, AI Analysis, Smart Analysis, and User Interface 1. This modular decomposition is an ideal foundation for a microservices architecture. Each module will be developed and deployed as an independent service, communicating over well-defined APIs and protocols.This architectural choice provides several critical advantages for a system like Tel-Insights:Separation of Concerns: Each microservice encapsulates a single business capability. For instance, the Aggregator Module is solely concerned with fetching data from Telegram, while the Advanced AI Analysis Module focuses exclusively on processing that data with LLMs. This separation simplifies development, testing, and ongoing maintenance, as changes to one service do not necessitate redeploying the entire application 17.Independent Scalability: The operational loads on the different modules will vary significantly. The Aggregator Module is primarily I/O-bound, its performance dictated by network latency and Telegram's API limits. In contrast, the Advanced AI Analysis Module is computationally intensive, its throughput dependent on LLM API response times and the complexity of the analysis. A microservices architecture allows these services to be scaled independently. The AI Analysis service can be scaled out to many instances during periods of high message volume, while the Aggregator might only require a few instances. This targeted scaling optimizes resource allocation and operational costs.Technological Flexibility: While Python is recommended as the primary language for its unified ecosystem, the microservices approach provides the flexibility to use a different technology for a specific service if it offers a compelling advantage. For example, if a future analytical task is best performed by a library only available in another language, that service can be built independently without affecting the existing Python-based services.Fault Isolation: In a distributed system, component failures are inevitable. A microservices architecture provides strong fault isolation 15. If the Smart Analysis Module encounters an error and becomes unavailable, it will not cause a cascading failure that brings down the entire system. The Aggregator and AI Analysis modules can continue their core functions of ingesting and enriching data, which will be available for analysis once the failed service recovers. This resilience is paramount for a system that aims to provide real-time insights.1.2 The Case for Asynchronous Communication: Implementing a Message Queue BackboneThe core workflow of Tel-Insights is a multi-stage data processing pipeline: message collection is followed by storage, AI enrichment, and finally, smart analysis 1. A naive implementation might use direct, synchronous API calls (e.g., REST) between these services. However, this would create a tightly-coupled and fragile system. In such a design, a failure or even a significant slowdown in any downstream service—such as the Advanced AI Analysis Module waiting on a slow LLM API response—would block the entire processing chain. This would halt the Aggregator Module, preventing it from collecting new messages and violating the project's primary goal of real-time, comprehensive news capture.To prevent this, the architecture will be built upon an asynchronous communication backbone using a message broker (such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka). This is the single most critical architectural decision for guaranteeing the system's data integrity and completeness. The message queue acts as a durable, persistent buffer between services, ensuring that every message captured by the Aggregator is eventually processed, even if analysis modules are temporarily offline or experiencing high load. This transforms the system from a brittle chain into a robust, fault-tolerant assembly line.The mechanism operates as follows:The Aggregator Module receives a message from Telegram.After initial parsing, it publishes a "New Message Received" event onto a dedicated message queue. This event is a self-contained data packet with the message content and essential metadata.The Aggregator's responsibility for that message ends there; it is immediately free to process the next incoming message from Telegram.The Advanced AI Analysis Module is an independent consumer of this queue. It pulls messages from the queue at its own pace, processes them, and updates the database.If the AI Analysis service is slow or temporarily down, messages simply accumulate in the queue. The Aggregator remains unaffected and continues to ingest data from Telegram without interruption or loss. When the AI Analysis service recovers, it begins processing the backlog of messages from the queue.This asynchronous, queue-based pattern provides loose coupling, superior resiliency, and non-blocking operations, which are essential for building a reliable system that can uphold its promise of comprehensive data capture in a volatile, real-time environment 15.1.3 Language and Development Ecosystem: Affirming PythonThe project specification's recommendation of Python as the primary development language is strongly endorsed 1. Python offers a mature, high-performance, and uniquely comprehensive ecosystem that is perfectly suited to every functional requirement of the Tel-Insights project.The rationale for standardizing on Python is compelling:Telegram Integration: The Python ecosystem contains the definitive, best-in-class libraries for interacting with both of Telegram's APIs. Telethon provides unparalleled access to the low-level MTProto protocol required for the Aggregator Module 5, while python-telegram-bot is a feature-rich, high-level framework for the Bot API, ideal for the User Interface / Alerting Module 6.AI/ML and Data Science: Python is the undisputed lingua franca of artificial intelligence. All major LLM providers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, offer robust, officially supported Python SDKs 20. This simplifies integration with the Advanced AI Analysis Module. Furthermore, should the project evolve to include custom model fine-tuning or more complex data science tasks, the full power of libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn would be readily available.Web Services and APIs: Modern, high-performance Python web frameworks like FastAPI or Flask are perfectly suited for building the lightweight microservices required for the Smart Analysis Module (MCP Server) and the internal API endpoints of other services 21.Database and System Integration: The language boasts mature and reliable libraries for interacting with all other components of the proposed stack, including PostgreSQL (psycopg2), message queues (pika for RabbitMQ), and cloud storage providers (google-cloud-storage).Adopting Python across all services will create a technologically homogenous environment. This approach simplifies the development workflow, streamlines dependency management, reduces the cognitive overhead for the engineering team, and significantly broadens the pool of available talent capable of contributing to and maintaining the project.Section 2: Technology Stack Analysis and RecommendationsThis section provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of competing technologies for each system module. Each recommendation is justified by mapping specific technological features to the unique requirements of the Tel-Insights project, ensuring that the chosen stack is not merely adequate but optimal.2.1 The Data Persistence Layer: A Definitive ChoiceThe persistence layer is the foundation of the system, responsible for storing all message data and the valuable analytical metadata generated from it. The choice of technology here will have long-term implications for performance, scalability, and the ability to implement future features.2.1.1 Relational Database: Why PostgreSQL is the Superior Choice for Rich MetadataThe project specification recommends a relational database for the Data Storage Module 1. Among open-source options, the two main contenders are PostgreSQL and MySQL. For the Tel-Insights project, PostgreSQL is the unequivocal and superior choice. Its advanced features are not merely "nice-to-haves"; they are critical enablers for the project's core analytical capabilities and future growth.The decision is supported by the following evidence:Superior JSON Support: The Advanced AI Analysis Module will generate rich, structured metadata (summary, topics, sentiment, entities, etc.) for each message, which is best stored in a flexible format like JSON 1. PostgreSQL's native JSONB data type is a decomposed binary format that is significantly more advanced and performant than MySQL's text-based JSON type 3. JSONB supports indexing of its contents, which is crucial for performance.Advanced Indexing for High-Performance Queries: The Smart Analysis Module needs to perform real-time queries on the AI-generated metadata to trigger alerts (e.g., "find messages where topic is 'Technology' and sentiment is 'positive'"). PostgreSQL supports GIN (Generalized Inverted Index), which can be applied directly to JSONB columns 2. A GIN index allows the database to efficiently find rows based on the keys or values within the JSON document, enabling sub-second query performance even on millions of records. MySQL's indexing capabilities for its JSON type are more limited and less performant for this specific use case 2.Complex Query Performance and Extensibility: The project's analytical requirements will inevitably lead to complex queries involving joins, aggregations, and window functions. PostgreSQL's query optimizer is widely regarded as more mature and performant for complex analytical workloads compared to MySQL 3. Furthermore, the project specification includes the extraction of 'Location' data 1. PostgreSQL's extensibility shines here with the PostGIS extension, the industry standard for storing and querying geospatial data 3. This provides a clear and powerful path for future feature development (e.g., "summarize all news within a 5km radius of a specific point") that MySQL cannot easily match.Data Integrity and Standards Compliance: PostgreSQL is renowned for its strict adherence to SQL standards and its robust, always-on ACID compliance by default 2. This guarantees a high level of data reliability, which is essential for a system that serves as a single source of truth for news analysis.While MySQL may have a reputation for being simpler to set up initially 23, the advanced capabilities inherent in PostgreSQL directly align with and empower the core features of Tel-Insights, making it the clear strategic choice for long-term success.Table 2: PostgreSQL vs. MySQL: A Feature-by-Feature Comparison for Tel-InsightsFeaturePostgreSQL CapabilityMySQL CapabilityImpact & Justification for Tel-InsightsJSON Data HandlingNative JSONB binary type.

Requires careful configuration 2.Critical. Guarantees the integrity of the core data asset, preventing data corruption during complex, multi-statement updates.2.1.2 Media Storage Module: A Cost and Feature Analysis of AWS S3 and Google Cloud StorageFor storing media files (images, videos, documents), a scalable object storage service is required 1. The leading choices are Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). While both are robust and feature-rich, the optimal choice for Tel-Insights is not independent of other technology decisions.A critical factor often overlooked in storage decisions is the cost of data transfer (egress), particularly when data needs to be accessed by services running in a different cloud provider's ecosystem. The Tel-Insights architecture requires the Advanced AI Analysis Module to process media files using an LLM API 1. If the media is stored in AWS S3 but analyzed by Google's Gemini API, every media file will incur AWS egress fees as it is transferred to Google's infrastructure for analysis. For a system processing a high volume of media, especially large video files, these egress costs can quickly dwarf the base storage costs.Therefore, the most cost-effective and performant strategy is to co-locate the media storage with the AI compute.Given the recommendation of Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro as the initial LLM (see Section 2.2), Google Cloud Storage (GCS) becomes the superior choice for the Media Storage Module.This recommendation is based on:Ecosystem Integration and Cost Savings: Storing media in GCS and processing it with a Gemini model running in the same Google Cloud region will minimize or entirely eliminate data transfer costs, as the data remains within Google's network 9. This provides a significant, ongoing operational cost advantage.Competitive Pricing: GCS Standard storage pricing (e.g., $0.020/GB in multi-regions) is highly competitive with, and often slightly cheaper than, AWS S3 Standard (e.g., $0.023/GB for the first 50TB) 11. Both platforms offer a range of storage classes (Infrequent Access, Archive, etc.) that can be used with lifecycle policies to further optimize costs for older media 11.Performance: Co-locating storage and compute reduces network latency, leading to faster analysis times for media files.Should a different LLM provider be chosen in the future (e.g., one hosted on AWS), the architecture's modularity would allow for migrating the storage strategy to AWS S3 to maintain these co-location benefits.Table 3: Cloud Object Storage TCO Analysis: AWS S3 vs. GCS (10TB/month Scenario)Cost ComponentAWS S3 (Assuming Gemini AI)GCS (Assuming Gemini AI)NotesStorage Cost (10TB @ Standard Tier)$235.52 (10,240 GB * $0.023)$204.80 (10,240 GB * $0.020)GCS is marginally cheaper for base storage 11.Ingestion Cost (PUT Requests, 2M)$10.00 (2M * $0.005/1k)$10.00 (2M * $0.005/1k)Request pricing is broadly comparable.Internal Access Cost (GETs, 5M)$2.00 (5M * $0.0004/1k)$2.00 (5M * $0.0004/1k)Request pricing is broadly comparable.AI Analysis Egress Cost (5TB to external AI)$460.80 (5,120 GB * $0.09)$0.00The critical differentiator. Data transfer within GCP is free; egress from AWS is costly 24.Estimated Monthly Total$708.32$216.80The co-location strategy with GCS results in over 70% cost savings in this realistic scenario.2.2 The Intelligence Core: Selecting the Optimal Large Language ModelThe Advanced AI Analysis Module is the heart of the Tel-Insights system, responsible for transforming raw messages into structured, insightful data. The choice of LLM will directly impact the quality of the analysis, the range of possible features, and the operational cost of the service.2.2.1 Comparative Analysis of Leading LLMs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) for 2025The LLM landscape is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, with leading models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic demonstrating state-of-the-art performance 7. For the specific tasks required by Tel-Insights—summarization, named entity recognition (NER), topic classification, and sentiment analysis—all top-tier models are highly capable 28.A critical architectural principle must be to build an LLM-agnostic abstraction layer. The system should not be hard-coded to a single provider's API. This approach, where the Advanced AI Analysis Module has an internal, standardized interface for analysis tasks, provides maximum flexibility and cost-efficiency. It allows the system to dynamically route requests to the best model for a given job based on cost, performance, or complexity. For example, a simple sentiment analysis could be routed to a fast, inexpensive model like Claude 3.7 Haiku, while a complex abstractive summary might be sent to a more powerful model. This "multi-model" strategy insulates the project from vendor lock-in, price hikes, or performance regressions from any single provider.For the initial implementation and MVP, a primary model must be selected. Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is the recommended choice. This recommendation is based on a holistic assessment of its capabilities in the context of the project's long-term vision:Native Multimodality: The project's future capabilities explicitly include the analysis of images and videos 1. Gemini was designed from the ground up as a multimodal model, capable of seamlessly processing text, images, audio, and video inputs in a single request 8. This native capability makes it an ideal foundation for the project's future growth, superior to models where multimodality might be less integrated.Massive Context Window: Gemini 2.5 Pro offers a 1 million token context window, with plans to expand to 2 million 7. This is a significant strategic advantage. It allows for the analysis of extremely long articles, documents, or even entire conversation histories from a channel without losing context or requiring complex chunking logic. This capability far exceeds that of competitors like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200k tokens) and GPT-4o (128k tokens) 7.State-of-the-Art Performance: Across a wide range of benchmarks for reasoning, coding, and knowledge, Gemini 2.5 Pro is highly competitive with or exceeds other flagship models like GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus 7. Its performance on visual and video understanding tasks is particularly strong, aligning with the project's multimodal requirements 7.API Pricing and Ecosystem: As discussed, Gemini's pricing is competitive, and its integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem provides significant cost and performance advantages for multimodal analysis when paired with GCS 9.Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet stands out as a strong and cost-effective alternative, particularly noted for its nuanced reasoning abilities and strong safety features 26. It would be an excellent candidate for inclusion in the multi-model routing strategy for tasks that require high-quality reasoning at a lower price point than flagship models.2.2.2 Best Practices for Prompt EngineeringThe quality and consistency of the AI analysis depend entirely on the quality of the prompts sent to the LLM. Prompts should not be treated as static strings but as a core component of the application's logic, subject to version control, testing, and continuous improvement. A critical architectural pattern is the implementation of a Prompt Management System. Instead of hard-coding prompts within the application code, they should be stored externally (e.g., in a dedicated table in the PostgreSQL database or a configuration service). This decouples the AI logic (the prompt) from the application code, allowing for rapid iteration, A/B testing, and updates to prompts without requiring a full service redeployment. This agility is crucial for continuously optimizing the AI's performance and cost-efficiency.The following best practices should be applied when designing prompts:Clarity and Specificity: Instructions must be unambiguous. They should be placed at the beginning of the prompt and clearly separated from the input text using delimiters like ### or """ 20. The prompt should be highly specific about the desired outcome, including the exact format (e.g., "Respond with a valid JSON object only"), length, style, and the list of entities to extract.Few-Shot Prompting (Show, Don't Just Tell): To ensure the LLM returns data in a reliable, structured format like JSON, the prompt must include 1-to-3 examples of the desired input-output pair. This "few-shot" technique dramatically improves the model's adherence to the specified format, making the output programmatically parsable 39.Focus on Positive Instructions: Prompts should articulate what the model should do, rather than what it should not do. For instance, instead of "Don't include an explanation," use "Provide only the JSON object in your response" 40.Parameter Tuning: For deterministic tasks like data extraction and classification, the LLM's temperature parameter should be set to 0 or a very low value. This minimizes randomness and creativity, leading to more consistent and predictable outputs 40.2.3 The Telegram Interface Layer: Selecting the Right Tools for the JobThe project requires two distinct modes of interaction with Telegram: one to aggregate data from channels as a user, and another to interact with end-users as a bot. These two modes are best served by two different Telegram APIs and, consequently, two different Python libraries. The architecture should therefore feature two separate microservices for these functions.2.3.1 Aggregator Module: User-Client Integration with TelethonThe Aggregator Module is required to connect to Telegram "as a regular user" to listen to channels 1. This functionality is only possible using Telegram's native MTProto protocol, as the standard Bot API does not permit logging in as a user or accessing the full history of arbitrary channels 5.The definitive Python library for this task is Telethon. The primary alternative, Pyrogram, is explicitly unmaintained and archived as of late 2024, making it an unacceptable risk for a new production system 41. Telethon is actively developed, well-documented, and the de facto standard for building custom Telegram clients in Python 43. It provides full access to the MTProto API, including capabilities far beyond the Bot API, such as downloading files up to 2 GB and retrieving complete channel member lists 10.A crucial operational consideration when using Telethon is the management of the session file. This file, which stores the user's authentication credentials, is highly sensitive. It must be treated as a top-tier secret and managed using a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), from which it can be securely mounted into the Aggregator's container at runtime.2.3.2 User Interface / Alerting Module: Bot-User Interaction with python-telegram-botFor the user-facing component that handles configuration commands and delivers alerts, the official Telegram Bot API is the appropriate tool 45. The ideal Python library for this purpose is python-telegram-bot (PTB).PTB is a mature, high-level, and fully asynchronous framework that provides a rich set of abstractions to simplify bot development 14. Its features directly map to the project's requirements:Comprehensive Handlers: PTB offers a wide array of handlers, including CommandHandler for commands like /start and MessageHandler for parsing user queries 6.Conversation Management: The ConversationHandler is a powerful tool for building the multi-step dialogues required for user configuration of alerts 6.Full UI Support: The library has full support for all of Telegram's UI elements, including the inline keyboards needed for interactive menus 6.Excellent Documentation and Community: PTB is extensively documented with numerous examples and is supported by a large, active community 6.Using PTB for the Alerting Module and Telethon for the Aggregator Module represents a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that each service uses the best and most appropriate tool for its specific job.Section 3: Detailed System and Module DesignThis section translates the high-level architectural strategy and technology selections into a concrete, actionable design. It details the end-to-end data flow, proposes a robust database schema, and defines the API contracts between the microservices.3.1 Overall System Flow and Data LifecycleThe system operates as an event-driven pipeline, orchestrated by a message queue. The lifecycle of a single Telegram message is as follows:Collection: The Aggregator Module (using Telethon) runs continuously, listening for new messages in the configured Telegram channels.Deduplication & Storage Trigger: Upon receiving a new message, the Aggregator calculates a SHA256 hash of any attached media 1. It immediately publishes a new_message_received event to the message queue. This event payload contains the message text, channel ID, timestamp, and the media hash. Concurrently, if the media is new (i.e., the hash does not exist in the database), the Aggregator uploads the physical file to the Media Storage Module (GCS).Asynchronous Handoff: The message queue now holds the event, decoupling the ingestion process from the analysis process.AI Enrichment: The Advanced AI Analysis Module, acting as a consumer, pulls the event from the queue. It constructs a detailed prompt using the message data and sends it to the LLM API (Gemini). For media messages, it includes the GCS URL in the prompt for multimodal analysis.Metadata Persistence: The LLM returns a structured JSON object containing the analysis (summary, topics, sentiment, named entities, etc.). The AI Analysis Module validates this JSON and writes it into the ai_metadata column of the corresponding message record in the Data Storage Module (PostgreSQL).Smart Analysis & Alerting: The Smart Analysis Module is responsible for higher-level analysis. Its "Frequency-Based Alerts" tool is triggered periodically (e.g., via a scheduled job). This tool queries the PostgreSQL database, leveraging the indexed ai_metadata to check for alert conditions (e.g., a spike in the frequency of a specific topic).Notification: If an alert condition is met, the Smart Analysis Module makes a secure API call to the User Interface / Alerting Module.User Interaction: The Alerting Module (using python-telegram-bot) receives the API call and sends a formatted alert message to the end-user on Telegram. This module also handles inbound user commands, such as an on-demand request for a summary, which it translates into a call to the Smart Analysis Module's summarize_news tool.3.2 Aggregator Module: Architecture and LogicTechnology: Python, Telethon, Message Queue Producer library (e.g., pika).Core Logic: This service's primary responsibility is reliable data ingestion. It will maintain a persistent TelegramClient session using a securely managed session file. An event handler (@client.on(events.NewMessage)) will be registered to capture all new messages from a pre-configured list of channel IDs. For each message, the module will parse the content, calculate the media hash, query PostgreSQL to check for media duplicates, upload new media to GCS, and publish the event to the message queue. It must incorporate robust error handling and retry logic for network interruptions, Telegram API rate limits, and storage upload failures.3.3 Data Storage Module: Proposed PostgreSQL SchemaA well-normalized schema is essential for data integrity and query performance. The following DDL (Data Definition Language) provides a blueprint for the core tables, leveraging PostgreSQL-specific data types like JSONB and TIMESTAMPTZ (timestamp with time zone).channels Table: Stores information about the source Telegram channels.SQLCREATE TABLE channels (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, -- Telegram's unique channel ID
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    ingested_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
media Table: Stores metadata for unique media files to enable deduplication.SQLCREATE TABLE media (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    media_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- SHA256 hash
    storage_url TEXT NOT NULL, -- URL to the file in GCS
    media_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    file_size_bytes BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_media_hash ON media (media_hash);
messages Table: The central table storing all message content and the associated AI analysis.SQLCREATE TABLE messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    telegram_message_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    channel_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    message_text TEXT,
    media_id INTEGER REFERENCES media(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    message_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    ai_metadata JSONB
);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_channel_id ON messages (channel_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_message_timestamp ON messages (message_timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_ai_metadata ON messages USING GIN (ai_metadata); -- Critical for performance
users and alert_configs Tables: To manage user settings for alerts.SQLCREATE TABLE users (
    telegram_user_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    username VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE alert_configs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(telegram_user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    config_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    criteria JSONB NOT NULL, -- e.g., {'type': 'frequency', 'keywords': ['AI', 'startup'], 'threshold': 20, 'window_minutes': 60}
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
3.4 Media Storage Module: Hashing and Deduplication StrategyTechnology: Google Cloud Storage (GCS).Core Logic: The deduplication process described in the specification 1 is sound and will be implemented as follows. When the Aggregator receives a message with media, it will stream the file's content to compute a SHA256 hash. This hash serves as the unique identifier for the media asset. A query is made to the media table for this hash. If a record exists, the new message is simply linked to the existing media.id. If the hash is not found, the media file is uploaded to a GCS bucket, using the hash as the object name (e.g., [hash].jpg) to enforce uniqueness at the storage layer. A new record is then created in the media table, and the message is linked to this new record. This strategy is highly efficient, minimizing both storage footprint and redundant data transfer.3.5 Advanced AI Analysis Module: Workflow and IntegrationTechnology: Python, LLM SDK (e.g., google-generativeai), Message Queue Consumer.Core Logic: This service will run as a pool of workers consuming from the new_message_received queue. It will implement the model-agnostic abstraction layer and the externalized Prompt Management System. For each message, it will fetch the appropriate prompt, format it with the message data, and call the configured LLM API. Robust error handling is paramount; it will use an exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient API errors (e.g., rate limits) and route persistent failures to a dead-letter queue for manual inspection. Upon receiving a valid JSON response from the LLM, it will perform an UPDATE operation on the messages table in PostgreSQL, populating the ai_metadata field.3.6 Smart Analysis Module: API Design with FastMCPTechnology: Python, FastMCP, FastAPI.Core Logic: As required by the specification 1, this module will expose its functionality via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using the FastMCP framework 12. This is ideal for the Contextual Message Summaries feature, allowing an LLM-powered client (like the Alerting Module bot) to call its functions as "tools." A standard internal REST API will also be exposed for programmatic functions like triggering alert checks.Table 4: Smart Analysis Module API EndpointsEndpoint/Tool NameProtocolMethodRequest PayloadResponse PayloadDescriptionsummarize_newsMCPtool_callJSON object matching a Pydantic model: {time_range_hours: int, topics: list[str],...}TextContent (string) containing the final summary.For on-demand summarization queries initiated by the user via the Telegram bot.

It will use PTB's ConversationHandler to implement a /configure_alerts command, guiding users through setting up their alert criteria, which are then stored in the alert_configs table 6. It will also have a general message handler to parse natural language queries (e.g., "Summarize tech news"). This handler will use an LLM call to translate the user's text into a structured request for the summarize_news MCP tool and then call the Smart Analysis Module. Finally, it will expose a secure, internal REST endpoint (e.g., /internal/send-alert) that the Smart Analysis Module can call to push proactive alerts to a specific user's Telegram chat ID.Section 4: Deployment, Orchestration, and OperationsA modern, automated approach to deployment and operations is essential for managing a microservices architecture effectively. The strategy focuses on containerization, a hybrid orchestration model, and a robust CI/CD pipeline.4.1 Containerization Strategy with DockerEach of the four primary microservices (Aggregator, AI Analysis, Smart Analysis, Alerting) will be packaged as a Docker container 48. Containerization is the standard for deploying microservices, providing numerous benefits:Environment Consistency: Docker encapsulates the application and all its dependencies into a single, immutable image. This guarantees that the service runs identically on a developer's machine, in the testing environment, and in production, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems 49.Process Isolation: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, with its own filesystem and process space. This prevents dependency conflicts between services 49.Portability: Docker containers can run on any host that has the Docker runtime, whether it's an on-premises server or any major cloud provider.For each service, a Dockerfile will be created. Best practices will be followed, such as using multi-stage builds to create lean, optimized production images and running the application process as a non-root user to enhance security 48.4.2 Hosting and Orchestration: A Hybrid Kubernetes and Serverless ApproachA hybrid orchestration strategy is recommended to leverage the distinct advantages of both Kubernetes and Serverless platforms, optimizing for cost, scalability, and control.Kubernetes (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine - GKE, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service - EKS): The core, "always-on" components of the system are best suited for a Kubernetes cluster. This includes:Aggregator ModuleSmart Analysis ModuleUser Interface / Alerting ModuleThe Message Queue (e.g., RabbitMQ deployed via a Helm chart)Kubernetes provides robust orchestration for these services, offering automated deployments, self-healing (restarting failed containers), service discovery, and fine-grained control over resource allocation and networking 49.Serverless (e.g., Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda): The Advanced AI Analysis Module is an ideal candidate for a serverless deployment. This module's workload is event-driven (triggered by a new message) and can be highly bursty. A serverless architecture offers:Cost-Effectiveness: You pay only for the compute time consumed while the function is actively processing a message. There is no cost for idle time. This is perfect for a workload that may be inactive for periods and then suddenly need to handle a spike in messages 49.Automatic Scaling: The cloud provider automatically scales the number of function instances from zero to potentially thousands to handle concurrent requests, without any manual intervention 17.Simplified Management: The provider manages the underlying servers, patching, and infrastructure, allowing the development team to focus solely on the application code 17.This hybrid model uses the right tool for each job: Kubernetes for the stable, long-running backbone of the application, and Serverless for the stateless, bursty, and computationally intensive data processing task.4.3 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline FrameworkTo enable rapid and reliable development, an automated CI/CD pipeline is a necessity. A platform like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins will be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process for each microservice.The pipeline will be structured in two main stages:Continuous Integration (CI): This stage is triggered on every code push to the version control repository. It will automatically:Run a comprehensive suite of automated tests (unit tests for individual functions and integration tests to verify interactions between components).Perform static code analysis (linting) to enforce code quality standards.Build a new Docker image for the modified service if all checks pass.Continuous Deployment (CD): Once the CI stage is successful, this stage handles the release to production. It will:Push the newly built and tagged Docker image to a central container registry (e.g., Google Artifact Registry, Amazon ECR).Automatically update the corresponding Kubernetes Deployment or Serverless function configuration to use the new image version. This will trigger a zero-downtime rolling update, gradually replacing old instances of the service with new ones 17.This level of automation is critical for managing the complexity of a microservices architecture, increasing development velocity, and ensuring that all deployments are reliable and repeatable.Section 5: Project Implementation RoadmapThis section provides an actionable plan for building and launching the Tel-Insights project. It decomposes the work into manageable tasks and proposes a phased rollout strategy to de-risk the project and allow for iterative development based on early feedback.5.1 Task Decomposition by Module and FeatureThe project will be broken down into a detailed backlog of tasks, organized by module. This provides clarity for the development team and facilitates project management. The following is a high-level sample of this decomposition:Module: AggregatorTask: Set up Telegram API credentials for a user account.Task: Develop Telethon client connection and session management logic, including secure storage of the session file.Task: Implement event handler for events.NewMessage.Task: Implement media hashing (SHA256) logic.Task: Integrate with GCS SDK for media uploads.Task: Integrate with PostgreSQL to query for duplicate media hashes.Task: Integrate with the message queue to publish new_message_received events.Task: Write unit tests for hashing and event publishing logic.Task: Create Dockerfile for the service.Module: Advanced AI AnalysisTask: Set up consumer logic for the new_message_received queue.Task: Design and implement the LLM-agnostic abstraction layer.Task: Develop the Prompt Management System (database schema and access logic).Task: Create initial prompts for summarization, NER, and sentiment analysis.Task: Integrate with the Google Gemini SDK.Task: Implement retry and dead-letter queue logic for API calls.Task: Develop logic to write ai_metadata to the PostgreSQL database.Task: Create Serverless deployment configuration (e.g., serverless.yml or function.yaml).(This decomposition would be fully elaborated for all modules in the project's task management system.)5.2 A Phased Rollout Strategy: From MVP to Advanced CapabilitiesA phased rollout is recommended to deliver value early and gather feedback. The project will be developed in three distinct phases, building upon the functionality of the previous one.Phase 1: MVP (Core Pipeline)Goal: Establish a functional, end-to-end data pipeline for text-only messages to validate the core architecture.Features:Aggregator collects text messages from a small, fixed set of channels.Data Storage (PostgreSQL) is set up and stores the text messages.Advanced AI Analysis generates a basic set of metadata (Summary, Topic, Sentiment) for text messages only.Smart Analysis implements the frequency-based alert, but operates on the raw message_text field as a simple proof-of-concept.User Interface / Alerting Module is capable of sending these basic, hardcoded alerts to a single user.Phase 2: Enhanced AI and User InteractionGoal: Leverage the full power of the AI-generated metadata and build out the user-facing interaction features.Features:The Smart Analysis alerts are upgraded to query the indexed ai_metadata field, enabling alerts based on AI-identified topics, keywords, and sentiment.The summarize_news FastMCP tool is fully implemented in the Smart Analysis Module.The Alerting Module is enhanced to parse natural language queries from the user and call the summarize_news tool.The ConversationHandler for configuring custom alerts is implemented.The full media storage and deduplication pipeline is activated.Phase 3: Multimodality and Advanced CapabilitiesGoal: Introduce media analysis and begin development of more sophisticated analytical tools.Features:The AI Analysis Module is upgraded to perform multimodal analysis (e.g., generating descriptions for images).New tools are added to the Smart Analysis Module (e.g., trend detection, event correlation).Development begins on the web-based management dashboard for administrators.Security hardening and performance optimization across all services.5.3 Security and Scalability ConsiderationsSecurity: Security must be a primary consideration throughout the development lifecycle.Secrets Management: All sensitive credentials—including the Telethon session file, database passwords, LLM API keys, and cloud service account keys—must be stored and managed in a dedicated secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault or a cloud-native equivalent (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager). They must never be hard-coded or stored in version control.Network Policies: In the Kubernetes environment, strict network policies will be enforced to implement the principle of least privilege. For example, only the AI Analysis and Aggregator modules will be granted network access to the database.API Authentication: All internal REST APIs will be secured, and any public-facing endpoints (e.g., for a future web dashboard) will require robust authentication and authorization.Scalability: The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability from the outset.The stateless microservices (AI Analysis, Smart Analysis, Alerting) can be scaled by simply increasing the number of running instances (replicas in Kubernetes or concurrent executions in Serverless).The Aggregator can be scaled by running multiple instances, each handling a different subset of channels, if ingestion becomes a bottleneck.The stateful components—PostgreSQL and the message queue—will be deployed using managed cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS, CloudAMQP). These services provide built-in scalability, high availability, and automated backups, offloading significant operational burden from the development team.Section 6: Conclusion and Strategic OutlookThe technical blueprint detailed in this report provides a robust, scalable, and future-proof foundation for the Tel-Insights project. By adopting a microservices architecture with an asynchronous, message-driven backbone, the system is designed for high resilience and fault tolerance, ensuring the integrity of the data pipeline.The recommended technology stack—centered on Python, PostgreSQL, Telethon, and Google Gemini—has been selected through a rigorous, evidence-based analysis that prioritizes not only current requirements but also long-term strategic goals. The choice of PostgreSQL provides a powerful data engine capable of handling the rich, structured metadata that is the core asset of the system. The decision to co-locate media storage (GCS) with AI compute (Gemini) addresses a critical potential source of operational cost, making the project's multimodal ambitions financially viable.Furthermore, the architecture is designed for agility. The implementation of an LLM-agnostic abstraction layer and an externalized Prompt Management System transforms the AI component from a fixed dependency into a swappable, continuously optimizable part of the system. This insulates the project from the volatility of the AI market and empowers the team to enhance the system's intelligence without disruptive code changes.The hybrid deployment model, combining the control of Kubernetes with the cost-efficiency and auto-scaling of Serverless, ensures that operational resources are allocated optimally. Paired with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, this strategy will enable rapid, reliable development and deployment.By following the phased implementation roadmap, the project can deliver value incrementally, starting with a core MVP and progressively building towards the full vision of a comprehensive, multimodal news intelligence platform. This architecture is not merely a plan to build the features specified today; it is a strategic framework designed to support the growth and evolution of Tel-Insights for years to come.
